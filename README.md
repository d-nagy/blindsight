# BlindSight

Web application that identifies objects and their positions (including facial expressions) in your immediate surroundings and their positions. Aimed at the visually impaired to be able to take a quick "look around".

It also provides functionality to recognize emotions in peoples faces, which can be used by both the visually impaired and users that may be unable to recognize emotions themselves.

We are using Google's Vision API for object recognition.
